# Contributing

Contributions are truly welcomed! Here are some good (common) ways to get started:

* **GitHub Discussions**: Currently the best way to chat around.
* **GitHub Issues**: Bugs! Fixes! PRs!.

Apart from these, since this project is mainly a JSON-based project, so in most cases contributions could be made by simply adding / editing various JSON files. It'll also be great if you can provide some examples for the new features you added.

And below will be explanations of what JSON files we currently have, and what they are used for.
